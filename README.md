# Socket Programming With Python
 
## Socket programming is a way of connecting two nodes on a network to communicate with each other. One socket(node)listens on a particular port at an IP, while the other socket reaches out to the other to form a connection. The server forms the listener socket while the client reaches out to the server.

# How To Run

    ifconfig
